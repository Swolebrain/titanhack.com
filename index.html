      <h3>Why choose TitanHack</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Neuroscience-based teaching.</strong> Teaching and learning are skills
          which very few people possess. I can help you become a master of learning.</li>
        <li><strong>Accommodating Schedule</strong> Each course is one month long and we meet all day on Saturdays.
          Homework is limited because struggling for 2 hours against a 10 minute problem is not an efficient
          use of time. We spend 8 hours together on Saturday and I force you to learn all day.</li>
        <li><strong>Content catered to you.</strong> Classes are live, online, and hands on. Each Saturday is an in-depth workshop
          designed to help you go through a full fledged, non-trivial project in a group of no more than 4
          students, under the guidance of a 10x Developer vetted by a top notch tech company.</li>
      </ol>
